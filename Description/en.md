This script operates on a simple mechanism of specifying the class name of button elements and physically clicking those elements.
Therefore, it can basically function on streaming services that have buttons like `Skip Intro` or `Next Episode`.
However, as I'm not subscribed to many services myself, I don't have a way to know these elements.
By adding to the code, this script alone can be made compatible with more services.
If possible, I would appreciate if you could provide the selectors for each service, as this would help improve the service.
